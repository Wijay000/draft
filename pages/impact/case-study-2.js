      <h1>Design system adoption — case study</h1>
      <p className="meta">Published Jul 2025 — cross-team collaboration</p>

      <p>Problem: inconsistent UI patterns across products caused rework and visual regressions. Teams lacked a shared component library and common primitives.</p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>We built a minimal component library, documented patterns, and provided migration guides. A small team owned the library and ran weekly office hours to support adopters.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Release cadence increased by 20% as teams reused components.</li>
        <li>Cross-team UI bugs fell by 45% in the following quarter.</li>
        <li>Onboarding for new engineers shortened due to clearer component docs.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Takeaway: Adoption is driven by developer experience — good docs, simple APIs, and a clear maintenance plan.</p>
