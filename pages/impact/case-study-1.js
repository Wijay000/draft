      <h1>Onboarding funnel redesign — case study</h1>
      <p className="meta">Published Aug 2025 — outcome focused</p>

      <p>Problem: new users were dropping off before completing the first meaningful task. The product team needed a way to increase activation without a large rewrite.</p>

      <h3>Approach</h3>
      <p>We mapped the funnel, identified the single biggest friction point, and redesigned a short flow that removed unnecessary steps. We shipped the change behind a flag and ran an A/B test for four weeks.</p>

      <h3>Results</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Time-to-first-success reduced by 28%.</li>
        <li>Activation rate improved by 15% relative.</li>
        <li>Support tickets related to onboarding fell by 32%.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Takeaway: Focused, measurable changes often outperform large, unfocused rewrites. We prioritized shipping an experiment, measuring, and iterating.</p>
