      <p>Most product teams never have perfect data. The useful skill is learning how to make defensible choices with limited information.</p>

      <h3>Define your hypothesis</h3>
      <p>Spell out the assumption, the expected change, and the smallest signal that would persuade you the change worked. Prioritize experiments that give clear directional evidence.</p>

      <h3>Prefer incrementalism</h3>
      <p>Small, reversible experiments reduce risk and let you learn faster. Use feature flags and gradual rollouts so you can iterate quickly based on real user behavior.</p>

      <h3>Combine qualitative with quantitative</h3>
      <p>Metrics are vital, but interviews and session recordings often reveal the 'why' behind the numbers. Use both to refine your next experiment.</p>

      <p>Making better product decisions is about improving the signal-to-noise ratio of your experiments — not waiting for perfect clarity.</p>
