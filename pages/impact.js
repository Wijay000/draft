The Forum recognized this gap and sought a way to amplify youth voices, not just through talk, but through action.",

The barriers were high: age, geography, lack of access to decision-making, and limited infrastructure for youth-led action.",

The design emphasised ownership, local relevance, and global learning. Members under 30 were invited to apply, run projects, innovate in their communities, and connect with peers world-wide.",

These Hubs have delivered local solutions addressing climate, skills, digital inclusion and more. The network plays a unique role in bridging local innovation with global influence.",

People were dying not because treatments did not exist but because they could not afford or access them. Medtronic, the world's largest medical device company, wanted to change this reality. Instead of improving its technology, the company sought to redesign how life-saving cardiac care could reach those most in need.",

As Venture Director at Innosight Ventures, I led field research across hospitals and clinics in India to map the full patient journey. We discovered four barriers that locked people out of care: lack of awareness, limited diagnostics, fragmented care pathways, and affordability. The breakthrough insight was that solving this challenge would require a new business model, not a new product.",

We created outreach campaigns that invited patients to free heart screenings through hotlines, mobile ads, and community events. We partnered with hospitals to run telemedicine-enabled camps for early diagnosis and follow-up. Most importantly, we built India's first consumer financing program for pacemakers, enabling families to pay through small monthly installments. The pilot launched at The Mission Hospital in Durgapur. The first patient, a 44-year-old mother named Angurbala, suffered from severe heart disease and lived on $65 a month. After her implant, she said, \"If it weren't for this program, I would not be alive today.\"",

The model proved financially sustainable and socially transformative, and Medtronic expanded it to hundreds of hospitals across India and later to other emerging economies. The initiative became a blueprint for inclusive innovation, demonstrating that when we design with empathy and rethink systems, we can turn advanced technology into accessible human impact.",

For young people, these pressures often limit education and opportunity, leaving them feeling unseen and uncertain about their future. As Entrepreneur in Residence at The Adecco Group, I conceptualized and launched a portfolio of social business initiatives to expand access to opportunity. Working with the Innovation Foundation and YouthBuild M√©xico, I explored how entrepreneurship and human-centered innovation could unlock potential in these communities. Together, we partnered with SkillLab's Evidence 4 Impact initiative to combine technology and social purpose.",

Traditional job programs were too narrow and failed to see the whole person behind the statistics. These women needed more than training; they needed tools, belief, and a pathway to reimagine what was possible for their lives and families.",

Through workshops, mentoring, and digital tools like the SkillLab app, participants assessed their skills, created professional profiles, and connected to opportunities that matched their aspirations. One of the most inspiring journeys was that of Laura, a 29-year-old mother who once believed she had only two employable skills. Using SkillLab, she realized she had dozens. She helped peers write their resumes, gained leadership confidence, and created a professional CV that opened new doors. Within a month of completing the program, she was promoted to area manager in her new job, citing SkillLab as her secret advantage.",

Dozens of young mothers like Laura have found meaningful employment, pursued education, and regained a sense of agency in their lives. Beyond employment, the program restored something deeper: pride, hope, and the belief that every skill, when recognized and nurtured, can shape a better future.",
