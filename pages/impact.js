The Forum recognized this gap and sought a way to amplify youth voices, not just through talk, but through action.",

          content: "How do you create a meaningful platform that empowers young voices across cities worldwide, from Dhaka to Detroit, to lead local change, while connecting them to a global network of peers and resources? The barriers were high: age, geography, lack of access to decision-making, and limited infrastructure for youth-led action.",

          heading: "Approach",
          content: "A youth-led hub model was developed: in each city, elected Shapers created local projects, formed autonomous Hubs, and connected to the global WEF platform. The design emphasised ownership, local relevance, and global learning. Members under 30 were invited to apply, run projects, innovate in their communities, and connect with peers world-wide.",

          content: "From its launch, the Global Shapers network expanded to over 500 Hubs in more than 150 countries and engaged tens of thousands of young change-makers. These Hubs have delivered local solutions addressing climate, skills, digital inclusion and more. The network plays a unique role in bridging local innovation with global influence.",
